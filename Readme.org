** Objective 
*** Migrate all content from Evernote to Org mode

    Due to the limited mobile support of Org mode, I've constantly switched
    between Org mode and a Evernote/Remember the Milk combination. As this
    changes now due to the initiative of [[https://github.com/MobileOrg/mobileorg.next][MobileOrg v2]], it's time to migrate my
    stuff fully over to Org mode.

    One of the reasons of using Evernote was the possibility to export all
    of it's content into XML. EverOrg uses these Evernote
    backup-files to generate Org mode files. 

** Features
   EverOrg reads an [[http://xml.evernote.com/pub/evernote-export3.dtd][ENEX]] document and converts it's markup to Org mode
   syntax. This could be done by using tools like [[http://pandoc.org][pandoc]]. But then all
   the attachments like images, voice-memos, scanned documents and so
   on would be missing from within org mode. 

   EverOrg reads in the file which is given as a parameter and
   creates one or many Org files with in the new location. In this location also an directory with the same name
   is created where all the attachments are stored. 
   
  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   Input file: common.enex
   Output file:
     - merge=true: common/common.org 
     - merge=false: common/*.org and common/common-attachments
  #+END_EXAMPLE


   Every stored attachment is referenced from within the Org document,
   either as an image which could be viewed inline or as an link so
   that the attachment could be opened easily within an external application.

   If the switch ~-regardDiv~ is set to true EverOrg inserts a newline for every <div> block.
   Within tables <div> blocks are ignored at any time.

** Usage
   Export notebooks from Evernote to ENEX files, and then convert them to
   org-mode with this command:

   #+BEGIN_SRC
   everorg --input=notebook.enex --merge=false
   #+END_SRC

   The output is one or many .org files and a folder with attachments.
   
   If you have many enex files in one folder, you can run easily in one script:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
#!/bin/bash
FILES=$HOME/evernote/*.enex

for f in $FILES ; do
  ./EverOrg --input=$f --merge=false
done
#+END_SRC

** Platform

    The first version of EverOrg was developed in Swift on MacOS. The aim is
    that EverOrg is platform independent so that Windows users would have had
    at least the option to use it in a VM under Linux. Unfortunately Swift
    under Linux does not work straightforward. I was not able to compile EverOrg
    on Linux without strange errors. Due to that I decided to write it again
    using Go which has extraordinary cross-compile possibilities.

    Binary files are available in [[https://github.com/mgmart/EverOrg/releases][Releases]].

** Status 

*** Known Issues
    - Web clips are not nicely displayed in Org
      - tables have still some linebreaks in table cells
    - Illegal characters in tags (for Org) are not filtered
    - Reminders are not processed (Those are still in RTM for me)
    - Note content is not formatted for the use within Org
      mode. =fill-paragraph= (=M-q=) should do the job whilst
      accessing the note in Org mode.

** Discussion

*** Properties
    I do not know if there are already any existing keywords used for
    the properties I've been using for EverOrg. But if there are,
    those could be easily adopted.
