** Objective 
*** Migrate all content from Evernote to Org mode

    Due to the limited mobile support of Org mode, I've constantly switched
    between Org mode and a Evernote/Remember the Milk combination. As this
    changes now due to the initiative of [[https://github.com/MobileOrg/mobileorg.next][MobileOrg v2]], it's time to migrate my
    stuff fully over to Org mode.

    One of the reasons of using Evernote was the possibility to export all
    of my content into XML. This EverOrg uses the Evernote
    backup-files to generate Org mode files. 

** Features
   EverOrg reads an [[http://xml.evernote.com/pub/evernote-export3.dtd][ENEX]] document and converts it's markup to Org mode
   syntax. This could be done by using tools like [[http://pandoc.org][pandoc]]. But then all
   the attachments like images, voice-memos, scanned documents and so
   on would be missing from within org mode. 

   EverOrg reads in the file which is given as a parameter and
   creates an Org file with the same name in the same location as the
   source file. In this location also an directory with the same name
   is created where all the attachments are stored.

   Every stored attachment is referenced from within the Org document,
   either as an image which could be viewed inline or as an link so
   that the attachment could be opened easily within n external application.

** Platform

    The first version of EverOrg was developed in Swift on MacOS. The aim is
    that EverOrg is platform in dependable so that Windows users would have had
    at least the possibility to use it in a VM under Linux. Unfortunately Swift
    under Linux does not work straightforward. I was not able to compile EverOrg
    on Linux without strange errors. Due to that I decided to write it again
    using Go which has extraordinary cross-compile possibilities.

** Status 

*** Known Issues
    - Web clips are not nicely displayed in Org
      - tables have still some linebreaks in table cells
    - Illegal characters in tags (for Org) are not filtered
    - Reminders are not processed (Those are still in RTM for me)
    - Note content is not formatted for the use within Org
      mode. =fill-paragraph= (=M-q=) should do the job whilst
      accessing the note in Org mode.

** Discussion

*** Properties
    I do not know if there are already any existing keywords used for
    the properties I've been using for EverOrg. But if there are,
    those could be easily adopted.
